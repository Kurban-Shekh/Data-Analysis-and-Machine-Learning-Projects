## Projects

### Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning

- **Date**: May 2024
- **Description**: Analyzed records of 5000 people using Python, performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover significant patterns and trends. Balanced the dataset using oversampling techniques to enhance model performance. Trained a KNN algorithm using scikit-learn, achieving an 87% accuracy rate, and improved recall, providing reliable stroke risk predictions.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Oversampling techniques

### Estimated Medical Charges Using Machine Learning

- **Date**: April 2024
- **Description**: Loaded and analyzed data of 1300 medical insurance customers using Python. Visualized data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to identify cost-driving factors. Trained a Linear Regression model with scikit-learn to predict medical charges accurately.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

### COVID-19 Data Exploration Using SQL

- **Date**: March 2024
- **Description**: Loaded and cleaned COVID-19 data from various sources using SQL. Analyzed and visualized data using complex SQL queries including Joins, CTEs, and Window Functions. Extracted key insights and created reports on infection and mortality rates across different regions.
- **Technologies Used**: SQL
